# Miscellaneous patches to programs and libraries
This is an ad-hoc set of my own patches that I've written to change the behavior of programs, fix bugs, and so on.  At some point or another, I have either contributed these patches upstream, to another project with more specific goals, or have tried one of the first two at least.  If you want to find patches to MATE or GTK+ applications, for functionality that may not be officially available yet, check here first!  Maybe I have what you need.

# Licensing and legal stuff
All patches contained herein are licensed under the same terms as the original files in the respective packages, unless otherwise noted.  For the most part, that means that the MATE patches are GPL version 2 or later, and the GTK+ patches are LGPL version 2 or later.  Have fun, and feel free to use these patches within the terms of the appropriate licenses.
